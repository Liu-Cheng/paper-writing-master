Develop a set of prompts that can help polish the writing of academic papers. Instead of simply using generic prompts for the polishing guide, we need to add more expert knowledge and demo texts such that the writing will be consistent with paper styles in the corresponding discipline. In addition, the writing requirements may vary in different sections of the paper and more specific prompts will also be beneficial. Fianlly, it should also allow the users to add specific details that are unknown to the LLM. Meanwhile, we want to explore how the details should be formatted such that it makes it easier for LLM to integrate them into the paper.

# Prompts for Abstract

# Prompts for Introduction

# Prompts for Related Work

# Prompts for Overview
